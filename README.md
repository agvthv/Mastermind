# **Mastermind Game**

Welcome to **Mastermind**, the classic code-breaking game brought to life in Java! Whether you're playing solo or challenging a friend, this version of Mastermind ensures fun, strategic thinking, and a touch of randomness powered by the Random.org API.

---

## **How to Run the Project**
### **Prerequisites**
- **Java 17+**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- **Maven**: Used to build and run the project.
- A stable internet connection (for Random.org API).

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
gh repo clone agvthv/Mastermind
cd Mastermind
```

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project was to implement a backend-focused version of Mastermind with a clean and modular design. This version includes features for both single-player and multiplayer modes, leveraging Java's object-oriented principles and the Random.org API to generate the secret pattern.

---
## **Features**
- 🎮 **Single-Player Mode**: Challenge yourself against the computer's randomly generated 4-digit secret pattern.
- 🤝 **Multiplayer Mode**: Take turns with a friend to guess the pattern. First one to crack the code wins!
- 🧩 **Feedback System**: Get detailed feedback after every guess, including:
  - Correct numbers in the correct positions.
  - Correct numbers but in incorrect positions.
- 🛠️ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests to ensure functionality for:
  - Validating guesses.
  - Ensuring players to stock to the rules of the game

## Game Rules
A 4-digit secret pattern is randomly generated (digits range from 0 to 7).
Players take turns guessing the secret pattern.

#### After each guess:
You’ll receive feedback on how many digits are correct and in the correct position.
You’ll also be told how many digits are correct but in the wrong position.

#### The game ends when:
A player correctly guesses the secret pattern.
All attempts are exhausted (10 guesses in single-player, shared in multiplayer).
